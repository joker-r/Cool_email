                           is appreciated that you took out time from your busy schedule for the 
                           sake of this proposal. We hope that this email finds you in the best of 
                           health and spirit.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Teknothon</b>&nbsp;is the annual techno-cultural festival of&nbsp;<b>Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi</b>&nbsp;which
                           promotes liberty, energy, enthusiasm and provides students with the 
                           opportunity to explore and rediscover themselves. Teknothon fosters 
                           creativity and imagination to stimulate the professional superiority and
                           proficiency. By providing a platform to showcase student art forms, 
                           Teknothon creates a buzz of activity in the final weeks of the term, 
                           driving students to reach their full artistic potential in an engaging, 
                           accessible environment. Each year, faithful alumni, students, faculty, 
                           family, friends and the surrounding community participate in the premier
                           festival celebrations where the Jamia Millia Islamia continues to 
                           remain a staple in their minds and hearts.&nbsp;<br><br>Coupled with the 
                           legacy of fellowship and pride, the Teknothon celebration is one of the 
                           largest collegiate festival celebrations hence one of the most eagerly 
                           anticipated events in the University calendar. The success of the 
                           festival celebration, year after year, is the likely emanation of the 
                           collective efforts of students, alumni, faculty, and members of the 
                           community.&nbsp;<br><br>This year, the festival activities will be held from&nbsp;<b>26-27 March 2018</b>&nbsp;and
                           we have already begun laying the foundation for a successful series of 
                           events. We have been able to continue this tradition of excellence 
                           through the assistance and sponsorship from companies and organizations-
                           like you!&nbsp;<br><br>It would be our distinct privilege to have your 
                           organization as a sponsor of the upcoming festival celebration. The 
                           festival celebration draws patronage from a diverse population of 
                           consumers and remains a valued occasion to bring increased advertisement
                           and revenue to your organization. We encourage you to invest in each of
                           the events with the expectation to reap countless benefits through this
                           new partnership. Serving as a sponsor is not just about giving, but it 
                           is an opportunity for your organization to forge and nurture a 
                           relationship with Jamia Millia Islamia and its community without walls.&nbsp;<br><br>We
                           hope that you will consider sponsoring Teknothon 2018 a worthwhile 
                           opportunity. To assist you with your decision, we have attached a 
                           proposal that includes a brief overview of the festival activities, 
                           benefits of sponsorship, and a detailed sponsorship guide. If you may
